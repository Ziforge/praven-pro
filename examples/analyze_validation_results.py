    print("""
1. **ACCEPT is highly reliable**
   - 100% precision (84/84 correct)
   - When Praven accepts a detection, it's definitely valid
   - Only 8.4% of detections auto-accepted (conservative)

2. **REJECT has false negatives**
   - 0% precision (7/7 were actually valid)
   - Species: Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (6), European Storm-Petrel (1)
   - These are edge cases where rules were too strict

3. **REVIEW captures the complexity**
   - 90.9% of detections need human review
   - Contains 411 invalids (45.2%) and 505 valids (55.5%)
   - This is appropriate for a validation tool - when uncertain, ask human

4. **Overall recall is excellent**
   - Catches 100% of invalid detections (411/411)
   - No invalid detections slipped through to ACCEPT
   - The system is conservative (prefers false alarms over misses)

5. **The 7 false negatives reveal limitations**
   - Lesser Spotted Woodpecker: Rules may be too strict on habitat/time
   - European Storm-Petrel: Coastal wetland edge case?
   - These need investigation to refine rules

    print("=" * 80)
    print("Recommendations")
    print("=" * 80)

    print("""
1. **Investigate the 7 false negatives**
   - Why were valid Lesser Spotted Woodpecker detections rejected?
   - Check timestamps and locations of these detections
   - Refine temporal/habitat rules to reduce false negatives

2. **Reduce REVIEW rate**
   - 91% review rate is too high for practical use
   - Add more confident ACCEPT cases (increase auto-accept threshold)
   - Keep REJECT conservative (high precision is critical)

3. **Consider confidence scoring**
   - Instead of binary ACCEPT/REJECT, use confidence scores
   - "REJECT (high confidence)" vs "REVIEW (low confidence)"
   - Helps users prioritize what to check first

4. **Validate reject decisions**
   - Current REJECT decisions have 100% false positive rate in this sample
   - Need to investigate if this is representative or sampling issue
   - May need to relax some validation rules
